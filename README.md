# GNSS (data pipeline)

This repository aims to describe the processing of GNSS data in order to obtain TEC from RINEX files and your projection in the ionosphere. 

- Read RINEX, orbits (Sp3 and MGEX) and DCB (bias) files
- Plotting TEC and ROTI maps
- Cycle-slips correction 
- Compute ionospheric piercing point
