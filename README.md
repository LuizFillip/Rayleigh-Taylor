# Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (Data analysis)

This repository aims to prepare geophysical data for compute Rayleigh-Taylor growth rates

## Theory background 

This is a well-known result for collisional interchange instability (also referred to as generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability) that includes not only the effects of gravity and ambient electric field but also those ofboth the zonal and the vertical components of the neutral wind velocity [see, [Basu, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JA000317)

$\gamma_{RT} =  \frac{\tilde{\Sigma}_{P, 0}^F}{\tilde{\Sigma}_{P, 0}^E + \tilde{\Sigma}_{P, 0}^F} \left(V_z - U_L^P - \frac{g_e}{\nu_{eff}^F}\right) K^F - R$
